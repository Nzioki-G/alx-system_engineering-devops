## Processes and Signals
PID: the ID number of a process<br>
Process: a running instance of a program<br>
To find a process' PID: use the command ```echo $$```<br>
To kill a process: use the command ```kill <proc_name>```<br>
Signal: An system/process interrupt<br>
Some signals can be ignored. But you don't ignore SIGKILL nor SIGSTOP
