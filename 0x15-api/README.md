## Microservices
As I understand: <b>microservices<b> are modularisation on the client's side or runtime<br>
An application is modular. These modules have endpoints that listen and respond to each other<br>
Example
> objects of a program are microservices i.e. they each handle a specific problem<br>
communication between objects is made possible by APIs i.e. the objects' public methods and properties
