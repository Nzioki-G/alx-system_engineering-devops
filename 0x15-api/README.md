# API
**A**pplication **P**rogram **I**nterface: mechanism for application components to communicate
<br><br>
### REST API
**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer: an API that uses HTTP for communication
<br><br>
### Microservices
As I understand: **microservices** are modularisation on the client's side or runtime<br>
An application is modular. These modules have endpoints that listen and respond to each other<br>
Example
> objects of a program are microservices i.e. they each handle a specific problem<br>
communication between objects is made possible by APIs i.e. the objects' public methods and properties
